# Fyh
The Fyh are an ascetic species, medium-sized humanoids with innate psionic abilities. The Fyh style of self-discipline and avoidance of self-indulgence gives the species a somewhat aloof demeanor that is frequently off-putting.
Fyh adventurers tend to be priests, healers or monastic warriors. They also form the core of most psionic-based organizations.
