# Dralasite
***Dralasites are a space-faring invertebrate "plasmoid" race***

## Description
Dralasites are short, rubbery aliens that have no bones or hard body parts. Their skin is a flexible membrane that is very tough and scratchy. It generally is dull gray and lined with dark veins that meet at the Dralasite's two eyespots. The internal structure of a Dralasite is very different from the other races. The Dralasite's central nerve bundle (brain), numerous small hearts and other internal organs float in a pudding-like mixture of protein and organic fluids. Dralasites breathe by absorbing oxygen directly through their skin, so they have no lungs. They are omnivores, but eat by surrounding their food and absorbing it, so they also have no digestive tract or intestines.

All Dralasites go through male, female and neutral stages during their lives (these phases can be controlled with medicines). Males release spores into the air, which drift until they become attached to a female. A young Dralasite then sprouts from its mother, eventually maturing and dropping off.

### Society and Customs
Dralasites are philosophical and thoughtful. Their communities are small, and many Dralasites prefer to live alone. Dralasites do not care about wealth, power or status symbols. They judge themselves by the quality of their ideas and their ability to discuss important ideas wisely.

Dralasites often hold large public meetings to discuss new ideas. Discussions and debates are among their favorite ways to relax. Steam baths are another popular Dralasite recreation. They mix perfumes and intoxicants with the steam. These effect Dralasites the same way alcohol does a human or yazirian.

Dralasites are widely known for their strange sense of humor. They love old jokes and puns that make humans groan. Many human comedians who could not find work in Human cities have become rich performing on Dralasite worlds.

Dralasites do not normally wear clothing, because it makes breathing difficult and interferes with their sense of smell. They usually carry their equipment on web belts. When they must wear clothing to protect themselves, they use special materials that let air reach their skin.

## Statistics
**Size**: Small

| Exploits ||
| ---- | ---- |
| **Scent** | Dralasite's breathe through their skin and are highly sensitive to odors. They gain 3 ranks (2d6) in scent, which acts as perception, but only where smell is involved. |
| **Lie Detection** | A Dralasites keen sense of smell allows it to 'read' pheromones, giving them the ability to discern a lie. They gain a +1d6 bonus when detecting lies or deceptions. |
| **Steady** | The short stature and complex muscular structure of the Dralasite gives it a sturdier stance. Anytime a Dralasite would fall or be rendered prone it can spend a LUC die to remain standing. |
| **Additional limbs** | A Dralasite can create a number of additional limbs equal to its Agility score divided by 2, rounded up. Each additional arm pair gives the Dralasite an extra action, though extra actions may not be used to repeat actions more than once. Growing or absorbing new limbs takes two turns, during which the limb is effectively useless. |
