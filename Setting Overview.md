# Setting Overview 
- multiple sentient space-faring species

## Galactic Balance of Power
4 major Galactic Powers
1. Naenurin League (Aephesh/Myconid/Fyh)
2. Zredrisk Hegemony (Xill)
3. Synthoid Dominion (Geosene)
4. Wyfurn 

Although the Naenurin League is the predominate galactic power, it currently finds itself challenged on multiple fronts.
1. The Zredrisk have appeared. Little is really known, but they have begun to raid and harass the border territories.
2. A cold war of containment and deterrence is ongoing against the Wyfurn.
3. An uneasy peace has been established with the Geosene.
3. The Aephesh, long the leaders and defenders of peace in the galaxy are dying and their strength to effectively rule the Naenurin League is waning. 
	1. The Aephesh expected to pass the mantle of leadership to the Fyh, but they have become increasingly disinterested in the role.
